 *
 * <p>Pay attention that this class is not thread-safe. It is highly
 * recommended to always decorate it with {@link SyncScalar}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class implements {@link Scalar}, which throws a checked
 * {@link Exception}. This may not be convenient in many cases. To make
 * it more convenient and get rid of the checked exception you can
 * use the {@link UncheckedScalar} decorator. Or you may use
 * {@link IoCheckedScalar} to wrap it in an IOException.</p>
